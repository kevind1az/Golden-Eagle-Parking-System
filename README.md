# Golden-Eagle-Parking-System
Golden Eagle Parking System (GEPS) is an Android Studio project that was started in my Software Engineering class to create an app that could track the amount of parking spaces available at Cal State LA. GEPS is aimed at streamlining visits to CSULA via monitoring of parking lot availability and contains QoL features such as auto-recommendation and tagging of your parking space. The program itself uses various image processing programs such as OpenCV & TensorFlow to detect available parking spots from a live feed camera (in our case it is pre-recorded). Although GEPS is not done in regards as a major-scale program, it still works as a test to see if our code would be able to detect parking spots with a pre-recorded aerial view video of a parking with cars occupying and vacating various parking spaces at a time.
